The site is live at https://3d-books-search.vercel.app/
A 3D search place to search for books. It will provide Amazon and Goodreads links to the book  ( via API calls ). The background of the web application is created in ThreeJS ( a 3d book interactive model ). It is a simple project I created to practice my skills in React and THREEJS. It is not the actual ReactJS code of the site, just the code to host the site, I will make the actual code available if required.
